TO DO:
1. Consider using ising-like model
2. Handle fractional R0.  Currently unhandled. Handle when infects more than R0?
3. Fit curve (gaussian) to infected plot. See if it sdev matches 14 days
4. Change AGENT class to use SIR labels, susceptible, infected, recovered.

5. To avoid contact with infected radius, vx ends up _always_ being positive.  Why?
