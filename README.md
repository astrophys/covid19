# My stupid attempt at modeling the coronavirus outbreak
#### Author : Ali Snedden
#### License: MIT 
## Purpose:
I'm curious if I can predict the outbreak behavior with an agent based model. This is a really ignorant attempt at modeling and I have no experience in these type of simulations.

## Installation:
Use a python 3 installation that includes common libraries such as numpy and matplotlib

## Usage:
This repo does several things.
1. It plots the Itallian covid-19 data from https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19.git
